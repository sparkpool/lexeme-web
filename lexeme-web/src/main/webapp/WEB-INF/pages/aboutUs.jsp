			<p class="pclass">Course Hero was founded by Cornell University student Andrew
				Grauer after he missed class one day. Realizing he’d have to
				awkwardly ask a stranger for notes, he dreamed of an easier way to
				get caught up in class. And so, he set out to create Course Hero, a
				platform where students can openly share their knowledge and
				discover all the educational resources they need to succeed.</p>

			<p class="pclass">That was back in 2006. Today, millions of students benefit
				from Course Hero’s supplemental study materials. For those exploring
				new subjects, mastering key concepts, and everything in between,
				Course Hero offers the personalized help they need to achieve their
				goals.</p>
