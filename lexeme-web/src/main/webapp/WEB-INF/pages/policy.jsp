Plagiarism

The plagiarism level that is regarded as acceptable by us is below 10%. In case plagiarism level is higher, you have the right to ask for revision or refund. For additional information considering these issues, you are free to view our Money Back Guarantee and Revision Policy. Please mind that bibliographical references (in-text referencing and bibliography page at the end of the papers) and clichéd phrases (idioms, standard phrases, connectors and other frequently used phrases) shall not be regarded as plagiarism and shall not be included in the plagiarism level calculation.

Payment

The pricing that you see in the Prices section of the website do not include VAT. It is charged only to customers from the European Union. It will be added to the cost of the order in the process of payment transaction. VAT is non-refundable.

Requests for refund and revision

We do not perform more than 3 (three) free revisions. If you want your paper to be revised after using the three available revisions, you have to place a new order for editing/proofreading.

If our Quality Assurance Department decides that your initial instructions are satisfied, your refund request will be rejected. Refund request is satisfied only when requirements listed in the Revision Policy are met. Please note, however, that the value added tax (VAT)is non-refundable.

After pressing the "Approve" button, you don't have the right to ask for any refund. In this case you can only ask for a revision, but only within 7 days after you press it. Do not press this button if you haven't checked the paper in the preview mode. If you cannot view the paper in the available format, please contact our Customer Support Representatives and ask them for another way to preview the document.

When asking for a full refund, you don't have the right to use the paper or any of the additional materials we may have provided you with in the course of work. All these materials become the property of our company and we reserve the right to publish the paper on-line for commercial purposes. We do not keep any kind of essay databases and 'publish on-line' means that if the paper is googled or checked with any kind of anti-plagiarism software, it will link back to our website. It may also be published as content or as a sample essay. This is done to protect our writers' work in those cases when the Customer claims a refund when work has been already completed.

Please note that you have 7 days to approve the paper. The approval time is calculated from the moment the last version was uploaded to your personal order page. After this period has passed, the paper (or a part of the paper) is approved automatically.

If you live in the European Union and have paid VAT in the process of the payment transaction, you do not receive it back with a refund. You get back only the money or a percent of the price stated in the Prices section of the website. VAT is non-refundable.

Proofreading

If you place an order for proofreading/editing, you cannot expect the writer to change more than 30% of the text. Proofreading is essentially us checking the work for you for any errors or plagiarized parts (we scan every submitted document for plagiarism).

Also, you cannot expect the writer to rewrite or create a brand new piece from what you upload. Nor can you ask the writer to rewrite an online article and still be charged for proofreading. Rewriting of any sort and proofreading are different.

Multiple Choice And Problem Solving

We can solve multiple choice questions tests and various problems for you. Special pricing applies, and you will need to fill in an order form for these two types of orders.

You will also need to upload the test or the problem for us to solve. We are not responsible for the grade you get. It is entirely up to you whether to trust our solution or not.
